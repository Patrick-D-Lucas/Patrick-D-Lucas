## 💫 About me

I'm a **Brazilian software engineering student** and I've been involved with programming for 4 years now. During this time, I've been studying languages and tools such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, React, Java and Spring.

I'm **passionate about technology** and, for me, software goes far beyond the code, it's the general processes that involve this universe, which has made me love the area even more.

I like solving problems and helping other people develop in programming, as well as learning from it because I still have a lot to discover. You can see **my main skills** below:
